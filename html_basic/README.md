# Web Development Project

This project consists of three HTML files: `base_index.html`, `index.html`, and `tweets.html`. It showcases a basic web development structure and includes navigation, content, and embedded tweets.

## File Descriptions

- `base_index.html`: The base HTML file providing the basic structure for other webpages.
- `index.html`: The main homepage HTML file containing information about the author, skills, interests, and a clickable image.
- `tweets.html`: A webpage displaying an embedded tweet and a placeholder for future comment threads.

## Folder Structure

- `css/`: This folder contains CSS files for styling the webpages (not included in this project).
- `images/`: This folder stores images used in the webpages (not included in this project).

## Usage

To view the webpages, simply open the HTML files in a web browser. Start with `index.html` as the main homepage. Use the navigation menu to switch between pages.

## Additional Notes

- The project follows a standard HTML structure, including the use of DOCTYPE, head, body, and various HTML elements.
- The webpages utilize semantic tags such as header, main, article, aside, and footer for improved accessibility and structure.
- The `tweets.html` page embeds a tweet using Twitter's widget.

Feel free to modify the content, style, and structure of the webpages to suit your needs.
